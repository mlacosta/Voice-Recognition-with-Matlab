# Voice-Recognition-with-Matlab
Voice recognition system using neural networks (2015 project)

This is a project I did back in 2015 when I was on college. Today I won't recommend to use a fully connected network, 
instead i'd suggest to implement a sequencial model like a LSTM net.

There exist a video tutorial I did of this project but it's only available in Spanish: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqXgMY0NPYo
