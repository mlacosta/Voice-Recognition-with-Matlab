Voice recognition system using neural networks (2015 project)

This is a project I did back in 2015 when I was on college. Nowadays, I won't recommend using a fully connected network for voice recognition, 
instead I'd suggest to implement a sequencial model like a LSTM net.

There exist a video tutorial ([HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqXgMY0NPYo)) I did for this project but it's only available in Spanish

For any request on how the system works send me an email to marianoacosta.003@gmail.com
